# Smart Weather Companion

This Python program provides comprehensive weather information, personalized recommendations, and temperature predictions, delivered daily at 7:00 AM.

## Overview

This project integrates several functionalities to provide a smart weather experience:

* **Detailed Weather Reports:** Retrieves and formats current, daily, and hourly weather information.
* **Categorical Conversion:** Converts numerical weather values (like UVI index and humidity) into descriptive categories (e.g., low, medium, high).
* **Wind Chill Calculation:** Calculates the perceived temperature based on actual temperature and wind speed.
* **Basic Clothing Recommendation:** Suggests clothing items based on the current weather conditions and a user-defined wardrobe.
* **Custom Weather Messages:** Generates personalized messages based on the prevailing weather.
* **LSTM Temperature Prediction:** Utilizes a trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future temperatures based on historical weather data. This model boasts high accuracy.
* **Automated Daily Execution:** Configured to run automatically every day at 7:00 AM using Task Scheduler.

## Features

* Provides current weather details (temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.).
* Offers a summary of the daily weather forecast.
* Presents a breakdown of the hourly weather forecast.
* Calculates and displays the wind chill temperature.
* Categorizes the UVI index (e.g., Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme).
* Categorizes humidity levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
* Recommends clothing items from a user-defined wardrobe suitable for the current weather.
* Generates a custom message (e.g., "Enjoy the sunny day!", "Don't forget your umbrella!").
* Predicts the temperature using a highly accurate LSTM model.
* Runs automatically every morning at 7:00 AM, delivering timely information.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* [Specify any weather API libraries used, e.g., `requests`]
* [Specify any data manipulation libraries used, e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`]
* [Specify any machine learning libraries used for the LSTM model, e.g., `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`]

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x installed on your system.
    * [List any specific Python libraries required. You can usually generate this using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and then listing the contents here.]
    * [Mention any API keys required and how to obtain them.]

2.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    * **API Keys:** Store your weather API key(s) in [mention where to store them, e.g., environment variables, a configuration file].
    * **Wardrobe:** Define your wardrobe in [mention the file or data structure used for the wardrobe, e.g., a JSON file named `wardrobe.json`]. The format of this file should be [describe the expected format].
    * **LSTM Model:** Ensure the trained LSTM model file ([mention the model file name, e.g., `temperature_model.h5`]) is in the correct directory.
    * **Task Scheduler:** This program is designed to run via Task Scheduler (on Windows). You will need to configure a task to execute the main script ([mention the main script file name, e.g., `weather_app.py`]) daily at 7:00 AM.

## Usage

This program is designed for automated daily execution. Once configured in Task Scheduler, you do not need to manually run it. The program will:

1.  Fetch the latest weather data.
2.  Process the data, including calculations and categorizations.
3.  Generate a clothing recommendation based on your wardrobe.
4.  Create a custom weather message.
5.  Predict the temperature using the LSTM model.
6.  [Mention how the output is delivered, e.g., sends an email, prints to the console (if you intend for manual runs), saves to a file].

**For manual testing or running outside of the scheduled time:**

```bash
python [main script file name].py
